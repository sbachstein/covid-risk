Author: Martynas Majeris\n *\n * Follow instructions in [on this page](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/tutorials/creating-translations/) to make corrections or add new translations.\n *\n * ---\n * Edit but leave the header section above this line. You can remove any\n * subsequent comment sections.\n * ---\n *\n * Use this file as a template to create translations. Leave the key part in\n * English intact.

Those will be replaced by actual\n * values during translation and should be retained in the translated prompts.\n *\n * Placeholder positions may be changed to better suit structure of the\n * sentence.\n *\n * For example \"From %1 to %2\", when actually used will replace \"%1\" with an\n * actual value representing range start, and \"%2\" will be replaced by end\n * value.\n *\n * E.g. in a Scrollbar for Value axis \"From %1 to %2\" will become\n * \"From 100 to 200\". You may translate \"From\" and \"to\", as well as re-arrange\n * the order of the prompt itself, but make sure the \"%1\" and \"%2\" remain, in\n * places where they will make sense.\n *\n * Save the file as language_LOCALE, i.e. `en_GB.ts`, `fr_FR.ts`, etc.\n */\nexport default {\n\t\"firstDayOfWeek\": 1,\n\t\n\t// Number formatting options.\n\t// \n\t// Please check with the local standards which separator is accepted to be\n\t// used for separating decimals, and which for thousands.\n\t\"_decimalSeparator\": \".\",\n\t\"_thousandSeparator\": \",\",\n\n\t// Suffixes for numbers\n\t// When formatting numbers, big or small numers might be reformatted to\n\t// shorter version, by applying a suffix.\n\t// \n\t// For example, 1000000 might become \"1m\".\n\t// Or 1024 might become \"1KB\" if we're formatting byte numbers.\n\t// \n\t// This section defines such suffixes for all such cases.\n\t\"_big_number_suffix_3\": \"k\",\n\t\"_big_number_suffix_6\": \"M\",\n\t\"_big_number_suffix_9\": \"G\",\n\t\"_big_number_suffix_12\": \"T\",\n\t\"_big_number_suffix_15\": \"P\",\n\t\"_big_number_suffix_18\": \"E\",\n\t\"_big_number_suffix_21\": \"Z\",\n\t\"_big_number_suffix_24\": \"Y\",\n\n\t\"_small_number_suffix_3\": \"m\",\n\t\"_small_number_suffix_6\": \"μ\",\n\t\"_small_number_suffix_9\": \"n\",\n\t\"_small_number_suffix_12\": \"p\",\n\t\"_small_number_suffix_15\": \"f\",\n\t\"_small_number_suffix_18\": \"a\",\n\t\"_small_number_suffix_21\": \"z\",\n\t\"_small_number_suffix_24\": \"y\",\n\n\t\"_byte_suffix_B\": \"B\",\n\t\"_byte_suffix_KB\": \"KB\",\n\t\"_byte_suffix_MB\": \"MB\",\n\t\"_byte_suffix_GB\": \"GB\",\n\t\"_byte_suffix_TB\": \"TB\",\n\t\"_byte_suffix_PB\": \"PB\",\n\n\t// Default date formats for various periods.\n\t// \n\t// This should reflect official or de facto formatting universally accepted\n\t// in the country translation is being made for\n\t// Available format codes here:\n\t// https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v5/concepts/formatters/formatting-dates/#Format_codes\n\t// \n\t// This will be used when formatting date/time for particular granularity,\n\t// e.g. \"_date_hour\" will be shown whenever we need to show time as hours.\n\t// \n\t// \"date\" is used as in default date format when showing standalone dates.\n\t\"_date\": \"yyyy-MM-dd\",\n\t\"_date_millisecond\": \"mm:ss SSS\",\n\t\"_date_second\": \"HH:mm:ss\",\n\t\"_date_minute\": \"HH:mm\",\n\t\"_date_hour\": \"HH:mm\",\n\t\"_date_day\": \"MMM dd\",\n\t\"_date_week\": \"ww\",\n\t\"_date_month\": \"MMM\",\n\t\"_date_year\": \"yyyy\",\n\n\t// Default duration formats for various base units.\n\t// \n\t// This will be used by DurationFormatter to format numeric values into\n\t// duration.\n\t// \n\t// Notice how each duration unit comes in several versions.
